## Vaccination coverage

Maintaining sufficient vaccination coverage is critical for establishing community protection. The charts below demonstrate how coverage for two critical vaccines has changed over time in Maryland and how it compares to neighboring states, national averages, and Healthy People 2030 (HP2030) targets.

PLOT PLACEHOLDER

In 2023, fewer two-year-olds were fully vaccinated against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (received all four doses of DTaP) in Maryland compared to the previous year. Maryland has higher coverage than the US median and higher coverage than neighboring states. Coverage in Maryland is below the HP2030 target of 90%.
